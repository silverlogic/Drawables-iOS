# Drawables-iOS (.club!)
===============

Send doodles to your Facebook Messenger friends with [Drawables](http://drawables.club/). 

Built during the eMerge Americas Facebook-themed hackathon, team TSL attempted to unite as many Facebook tools (Login, Messenger, Parse, and React) as possible. Our product, an image drawing and sharing iOS application uses the following products:

- Facebook login was implemented for user authentication on the iOS app and web admin
- Facebook Message was implemented as a medium in which to send the user-generated images
- Parse was used as a simple backend for both the app and the webadmin
- Parse sample iOS app was used as a starting point for the app
- ReactJS was used as the frontend for the simple web admin

We used [DEVAID](http://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/website-templates/devaid-free-bootstrap-theme-developers/) -- a Bootstrap template -- to create our apps' [marketing page](http://drawables.club/), and the [ACEDrawing](https://github.com/acerbetti/ACEDrawingView) component to allow our users to paint. 

All art was done by teammate Cordell, marketing page, product management, and UX by teammate Lauren, Parse and ReactJS by Regynald, and iOS by David and Cristina.
